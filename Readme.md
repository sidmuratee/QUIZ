create an array of objects 
    an image url
    description of that image

display the initial image with the initial description

when that image or description is clicked, re-render the image so that it is now the second image with the second description shown and so on

have overall counter start at 60 seconds separate timer that counts down that restarts the timer when you get back to the first image

set up an interval that switches the image and the description every 10 seconds since the last click

if you reach the end of the array, the next image will be the first image
